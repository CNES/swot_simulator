Simulation of errors for the nadir altimeter
============================================

Two main components of the nadir altimetry error budget are simulated : the
altimeter noise and residual wet tropospheric errors. For the altimeter noise,
the noise follows a spectrum of error consistent with global estimates from the
Jason-2 altimeter. The wet tropospheric residual errors are generated using the
simulated wet tropospheric signal and radiometer beam convolution described
above for the KaRIN data.
