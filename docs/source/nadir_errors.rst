Simulation of errors for the nadir altimeter
============================================

Two main components of the nadir altimetry error budget are simulated : the
altimeter noise and residual wet-tropo errors. For the altimeter noise, the
noise follow a spectrum of error consistent with global estimates from the
Jason-2 altimeter. The wet tropo residual errors are generated using the
simulated wet tropo signal and radiometer beam convolution described above for
the KaRIN data.
